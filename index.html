                From Biology to Browsers, Meet Alex Brady
            </h1>
            <p class="intro">
                After four years working in the tech space, I decided it was
                time to flip the script—swapping recruitment calls for
                console.log() and career coaching for clean code. I have a
                Master’s in Biology from the University of Sheffield and a
                curiosity that just won’t quit, I’m diving straight into HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript via _Nology. Now, instead of just talking to
                great developers I’m becoming one
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                While I’m new to web development, I’m not new to solving
                problems, communicating clearly, and getting things done. Here’s
                what I’m bringing with me:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    People skills, perfected. Four years in technical
                    recruitment sharpened my ability to communicate with all
                    kinds of people—developers, designers, stakeholders—and
                    translate technical needs into real-world solutions
                </li>
                <li>
                    Analytical mindset. My background in Biology means I’ve
                    spent a lot of time analyzing complex systems. Debugging
                    code? Just a different kind of organism to dissect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Project management instincts. From managing hiring pipelines
                    to juggling client expectations, I’ve learned how to stay
                    organized, prioritize tasks, and hit deadlines (without
                    losing my mind).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Curiosity + adaptability. Whether it’s genomics or
                    JavaScript, I love digging into new topics and learning
                    fast. I don’t mind being the beginner—because I won’t be one
                    for long.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="intro">
                I'm not just learning how to build websites—I'm building a new
                career on a strong foundation of skills I already know work.
